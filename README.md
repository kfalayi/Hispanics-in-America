# US isn't just attracting thousands of Hispanic immigrants with its visa annually, it's economy depends on it.
The original idea behind this story is to find out which continent most of America's immigrants are coming from. Of course, that's stupid! That teaches me nothing, right?
So, I downloaded a [dataset](https://github.com/kfalayi/Hispanics-in-America/blob/main/US_ImVisa_continent.xlsx) of immigrant visa approvals from 2010 to 2020 from the State Department travel [website](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/visa-law0/visa-statistics.html). 
I chose this time range to exclude years from 2020 till date due to how the pandemic affected travels and employment.
I filtered down the data I got from the U.S. State Department to find out visa approval volume for each country and saved it in [this CSV](https://github.com/kfalayi/Hispanics-in-America/blob/main/visaCountry.xlsx). 
Two facts came out of analysing the data at this point:
-  Most immigrant visas went to countries Hispanic and Latin American countries
-  Three countries - Mexico, Dominican Republic and El Salvador are the countries where most immigrants come from.
 The U.S. gave these three countries alone one quarter of all immigrant visas in the last three years.

So, I decided to head where the data took me. Why is the U.S. attracting immgrants from Hispanic countries more than others?
I decided to look at the share of the US labor force that identify as Hispanic with the data from the [Bureau of Labor Statistics].(https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.t01.htm) which I saved in this [CSV](https://github.com/kfalayi/Hispanics-in-America/blob/main/labour_ethnicity_2020.xlsx).
It turns out that the figure is not out of the ordinary. But of course, the figure is undercounted because undocumented immigrants who are as important to the US. economy as documented are not counted in the Bureau of Labor Statistics figure.
But I felt it still okay to go ahead with the figure of legal immigrants I have.
I decided to look into specific sectors to see how the proportion Hispanic immigrants in the labor force is represented.
I looked at the top sectors where Hispanics have highest representation and also the lowest. I saved the highest representation sectors [here](https://github.com/kfalayi/Hispanics-in-America/blob/main/topfield.csv) and sectors with lowest represention [here](https://github.com/kfalayi/Hispanics-in-America/blob/main/lowfield.csv). 
My findings show:
- In sectors where the proportion of Hispanic workers is lowest, it is stil still higher than other immigrant groups.
- For many of the sectors, the ratio of Hispanic workers to population in labor force is higher. 
But note that again, this figure does not give the full picture of the number of Hispanics in the labor force because the Bureau of Labor Statistics does not include undocumented immigrants.
